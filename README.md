# REST Countries API with Color Theme Switcher

![Project Preview](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a fully functional web application that integrates with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to provide comprehensive data about countries. Users can explore details such as population, region, subregion, capital, native name, and border countries. The project also includes a color theme switcher for better usability.

## Features

- Display all countries fetched from the REST Countries API.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for countries by name.
- **Filter by Region**: View countries based on selected regions (e.g., Asia, Europe).
- **Country Details Page**: Click on a country to view additional details and navigate to border countries.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light color themes for enhanced user experience.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: REST Countries API for fetching real-time country data.
- **CSS Framework**: Flexbox for layout and responsive design.
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for repository management.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PDineshMurugan/rest-countries-api.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rest-countries-api
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the app or use a local server for better performance:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

## Installation Instructions

This project does not require any specific installation since it uses vanilla JavaScript and static assets. Simply clone the repository and open the project in your favorite browser.

## Challenges and Learning

1. **Dynamic API Integration**:
   - Parsing and displaying API data dynamically using JavaScript.
   - Managing asynchronous requests with the `fetch` API.
   
2. **Dark/Light Mode**:
   - Implementing a theme switcher that persists user preferences using `localStorage`.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensuring the website is fully responsive and functional across various screen sizes.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Addressing API downtime by using a fallback JSON data file.

## Improvements in Future

- Add animations for theme transitions.
- Incorporate user geolocation to display region-specific highlights.
- Optimize API requests to improve load times for large datasets.
